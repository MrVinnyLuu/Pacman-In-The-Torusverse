"The Torusverse will focus more on the maps provided for the game, and included features to allow characters to, for example, exit from the left and reappear on the right (doing this left-right and topbottom effectively makes the map a torus). Further, the game will support multiple levels so players can progress from one level to the next. To provide these maps, Torusverse will need a map editor and tester."

## Running the Project
- Download the repository
- Add "jdom-1.1.3.jar" and "JGameGrid.jar" as libraries
- Run the Driver program with the following arguments:
  - No arguments: to enter map editor
  - Level file (e.g. `GameFolder/1SpecMap.xml`): to play that level
  - Game folder (e.g. `GameFolder`): to play through the levels in that game
